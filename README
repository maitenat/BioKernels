BioKernels: kernels based on biological sequence data.

This package allows the user to create some biological kernels i.e. kernels based in a series of biological measures: 
BLAST alignment, Smith-Waterman alignment, PFAM domain search and hydropathy pattern recognition. 

Unfortunatelly, it is still only available for GNU/Linux systems.

Current version is version 1.0 (2015-06-16).

The package can easily be installed by typing the following command: R CMD INSTALL BioKernels_1.0.tar.gz
